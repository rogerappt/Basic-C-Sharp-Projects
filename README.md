    Projects
    Blackjack Game
  This console application simulates the popular casino game Blackjack. The program allows players to play against the computer, following standard Blackjack rules. The game includes features such as betting and splitting hands.

    Car Insurance
  This is a simple car insurance quote calculator developed using C#. It takes user input such as age, gender, and car model, and calculates an estimated insurance quote based on that information.
